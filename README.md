#  RAD DIFF CHECK FRONTEND
### Github links
Frontend code: https://github.com/rishabbahal9/RADPAIR_ASSIGNMENT_FE

## Overview
FRONTEND code is written in ReactJS. This React project is created with create-react-app. It contains 3 pages: Form page, submit page and page not found.

Irrespective of input in template Id, you will get report template. Both inputs are required to submit the form. On submission, this frontend app used backend end point`<backend link>/get-report-template` to access the report template. Then we navigate to form submit page where report template and user's report input is compared.
